# Odin Sign-Up Form
Check out the GitHub pages deployment [here](https://nathaniel-lowy.github.io/odin-sign-up-form/)

This is based on [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s [Sign-up Form project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form). It is for practicing using intermediate HTML and CSS, in particular focusing on forms and relevant CSS. This page uses basic client-side validation and pseudo-classes/elements for a better UX.
